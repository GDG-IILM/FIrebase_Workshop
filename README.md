# GDG Workshop Login Page with Firebase Authentication

Welcome to the **GDG Workshop Login Page** project! This project features a sleek, modern, and animated login system for the GDG IILM_CET workshop. The project includes Firebase authentication for secure login and sign-up functionality, supporting traditional email/password logins and social logins with **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook**.

The design emphasizes clean aesthetics with dynamic background animations and smooth form transitions, providing an elegant user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Firebase Authentication**:
  - Login and register with **Email/Password**.
  - Social logins: **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook**.
- **Aesthetic Design**:
  - Modern UI with animated background and stylish forms.
  - Smooth transitions between login and sign-up pages.
  - Button hover animations and glowing effects on input focus.
- **Mobile Responsive**:
  - Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## üìö Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** to handle Firebase authentication.
- **Firebase** for backend authentication.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdg-workshop-login.git
cd gdg-workshop-login
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to **Authentication** and enable **Email/Password**, **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook** sign-in methods.
3. Get your Firebase configuration credentials (API key, project ID, etc.).
4. Open `app.js` and replace the `firebaseConfig` object with your Firebase credentials.

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### 3. Open the Project

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You can now test the login/signup forms and social logins.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```plaintext

‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Main HTML file with login and sign-up forms.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css         # CSS file for animations and styling.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js             # JavaScript file for Firebase authentication.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation (this file).
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

The project integrates Firebase authentication, allowing users to log in or sign up with their credentials. Firebase securely handles all authentication mechanisms, including email/password and social media logins (Google, GitHub, and Facebook).

When a user logs in, Firebase validates the user data and returns authentication status. Social logins are supported through OAuth integration with Firebase.

## üé® Animations and Aesthetics

The UI includes the following animations and design improvements:

- **Dynamic Gradient Background**:
  - A gradient background with smooth color transitions, created using CSS keyframe animations.
  - Animation effect shifts colors diagonally, creating a visually engaging experience.

- **Form Slide-in Animation**:
  - The login and sign-up forms appear with a subtle slide-in animation when the page is loaded, offering a professional feel.
  
- **Button Hover Effects**:
  - Buttons change colors and scale slightly on hover for interactive feedback.
  - A smooth transition is applied to provide a clean, fluid interaction.
  
- **Input Field Focus Glow**:
  - Input fields glow with a slight blue outline when focused, giving a clean and polished look.
  
- **Smooth Form Switching**:
  - Clicking between login and sign-up forms causes the forms to slide left and right with a smooth transition for seamless navigation.

## üîß Firebase Authentication Setup

- **Email/Password Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in using their email and password. Passwords are securely hashed and stored by Firebase.
- **Google, GitHub, and Facebook Logins**: Users can also authenticate using social media platforms. These logins are handled via Firebase's OAuth system, making it easy to integrate without handling OAuth flows manually.

## üíª Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, ensure you have your Firebase configuration ready, and then follow these steps:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Test the various authentication methods:
   - **Email/Password**: Register and log in using an email and password.
   - **Google, GitHub, Facebook**: Log in using your social accounts.
3. Make sure to handle any redirects or authorization prompts from social platforms (if required).

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can easily customize this project to match your own branding:

- **Colors and Styles**: Modify the gradient background, button colors, and form styling in `styles.css` to fit your own brand‚Äôs aesthetic.
- **Animations**: Adjust the keyframe animations or transitions to alter the visual effects.
- **Firebase Configuration**: Swap out the Firebase credentials with your own project settings in `app.js`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- Ensure that your Firebase project has **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook** authentication methods enabled in the **Authentication** section.
- For social logins, make sure the OAuth providers are set up correctly, and API keys are configured within your Firebase project.
